=========

*otl-modem* is a hardware-design for the [IcoBoard](http://icoboard.org) FPGA
board for the [RasberryPI](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) involving which
integrate dual ADC/DAC boards. The firmware is synthesized using the
[IceStorm](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/) tool-chain; a fully open-source
synthesis tool-chain for the
[Lattice ICE40HX8K](http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/FPGAandCPLD/iCE40.aspx)
FPGA.
